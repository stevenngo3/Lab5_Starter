1. I wouldn't use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because unit testing involves testing individual parts of the code, but the message feature has multiple parts to it, so it's probably better to test the message feature as a whole.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because this feature is an individual part of the messaging application and it can be tested easily and quickly, which would suit well for unit tests.
